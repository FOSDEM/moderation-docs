Welcome to FOSDEM and thank you for volunteering to moderate talk chatrooms on [chat.fosdem.org](https://chat.fosdem.org).

## In a nutshell
You'll be the host of one or more talks. You'll moderate the chatroom, collect questions for the Q&A and ensure that the experience is smooth for both speaker and attendee.

The talk itself will be prerecorded, but the Q&A afterwards is live video.

## Before the conference
Before you can begin, you must create an account on [penta.fosdem.org](https://penta.fosdem.org). You'll then have to enter the account name in your profile on [volunteers.fosdem.org](https://volunteers.fosdem.org) so we can link you to talks you agreed to moderate.

### Get in touch

As soon as you have been confirmed as a host on one or more talks, get in touch with the speaker. Introduce yourself as the talk host to the speaker (we will provide you with a way to contact them) a few days before the conference, explaining what you will be doing during the conference.

### Watch the video
Before the conference, take some time to watch the video so you know what it's about. If there is a problem with the video or the quality is not good, contact the speaker immediatly.
