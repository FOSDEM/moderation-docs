Welcome to FOSDEM and thank you for volunteering to moderate talk chatrooms on [chat.fosdem.org](https://chat.fosdem.org).

## In a nutshell
You'll be the host of one or more talks. You'll moderate the chatroom, collect questions for the Q&A and ensure that the experience is smooth for both speaker and attendee.

The talk itself will be prerecorded, but the Q&A afterwards is live video.

## Before the conference
Before you can begin, you must create an account on [penta.fosdem.org](https://penta.fosdem.org). You'll then have to enter the account name in your profile on [volunteers.fosdem.org](https://volunteers.fosdem.org) so we can link you to talks you agreed to moderate.

### An account on Pentabarf
![Create an account on penta.fosdem.org.](/images/penta-create-account.png "Create an account on penta.fosdem.org.")
Go to [penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22) to create an account. Fill in all the details and ensure you confirm your account.

If you already have an account (Pentabarf uses e-mail as primary identification), you can log in with your e-mail address and your password.

### Link your account on volunteers.fosdem.org
![Link your account on volunteers.fosdem.org](/images/volunteers-account.png "Link your account on volunteers.fosdem.org.")
To make sure we can automatically allow your account to preview the video's and have the correct access and moderation permissions on chat.fosdem.org, you must put your Penta username in your account information on [_volunteers.fosdem.org_](https://volunteers.fosdem.org). Go to the website and access your account details (_volunteers.fosdem.org/volunteers/<your username>/edit_). In the field _Your pentabarf account name_, enter the account name you either just created or already have on _penta.fosdem.org_. Click on _Save changes_.

It can take some time before everything is configured correctly, as the changes are made with batch jobs. If it is urgent (e.g. during FOSDEM), contact us in the [_#infodesk_](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#INFODESK:fosdem.org) channel on _chat.fosdem.org_.

### Get in touch

As soon as you have been confirmed as a host on one or more talks, get in touch with the speaker. Introduce yourself as the talk host to the speaker (we will provide you with a way to contact them) a few days before the conference, explaining what you will be doing during the conference.

### Watch the video
Before the conference, take some time to watch the video so you know what it's about. If there is a problem with the video or the quality is not good, contact the speaker immediatly.

![List of all your events.](/images/pentabarf-my-events.png "List of all your events.")
Got to [penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/events](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/events) to see the list of talks you have been confirmed as host of. Click on each of the talks you see in the list to go to the talk details page.

![Event details.](/images/pentabarf-overview-review-1.png "Event details.")
On the details page, scroll down until you arrive at the _Schedule_ block. Click on the _Review_ button, which will take you to the video page.

![Review the video.](/images/video-review.png "Review the video.")
You can view the video on this page. It could be that no video has been uploaded yet; if this happens close to the event, contact the speaker as soon as possible to make sure they will upload the video on time.


## During the conference
Test your setup, especially your microphone and webcam.

### Enter the chatroom
You should have received two invitations. One is for the main (public) chat room, where the viewers will be, and one is for the backstage chat room, where you can talk with the speaker and any FOSDEM staff present in private.

 * [_#test:fosdem.org_](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#test:fosdem.org) - the main devroom where the presentation will be shown and the public will be (_note that this is a test devroom and doesn't actually work_).
 * [_#test-backstage:fosdem.org_](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#test-backstage:fosdem.org) - the backstage chat room (by invitation only) where you can speak with the presenter in private.

 Ensure you are present and available at least 30 minutes before the talk is due to start, so that we know if something is wrong before the the presentation happens.

### During the presentation
![New talk is due to start soon.](/images/announcement-next-talk.png "New talk is due to start soon.")
The video will be started by the FOSDEM magicians automatically at the scheduled time. A bot will announce that the next talk is due to start. All talks are prerecorded, so during the talk the presenter is available to chat with in the _backstage_ room.

![An upvoted question.](/images/an-upvoted-question.png "An upvoted question.")
During the talk, encourage attendees to ask questions and to upvote (messages can be upvated by reacting to the messages with a thumbs up, or downvote them with a thumbs down - see [here](https://fosdem.org/2022/practical/online/) for more details). You can discuss the questions with the speaker while the presentation is in progress in the _backstage_ room.

### During Q&A
![Q&A will start soon.](/images/talk-about-to-end.png "Q&A will start soon.")
As soon as the video reaches its end, the bot will announce that Q&A is starting.

Questions are answered live
