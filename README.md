Welcome to FOSDEM and thank you for volunteering to moderate talk chatrooms on [chat.fosdem.org](https://chat.fosdem.org).

## In a nutshell
You'll be the host of one or more talks. You'll moderate the chatroom, collect questions for the Q&A and ensure that the experience is smooth for both speaker and attendee.

The talk itself will be prerecorded, but the Q&A afterwards is live video.

## Before the conference
Before you can begin, you must create an account on [penta.fosdem.org](https://penta.fosdem.org). You'll then have to enter the account name in your profile on [volunteers.fosdem.org](https://volunteers.fosdem.org) so we can link you to talks you agreed to moderate.

### An account on Pentabarf
![Create an account on penta.fosdem.org.](/images/penta-create-account.png "Create an account on penta.fosdem.org.")
Go to [penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22) to create an account. Fill in all the details and ensure you confirm your account.

If you already have an account (Pentabarf uses e-mail as primary identification), you can log in with your e-mail address and your password.

### Link your account on volunteers.fosdem.org
![Link your account on volunteers.fosdem.org](/images/volunteers-account.png "Link your account on volunteers.fosdem.org.")
To make sure we can automatically allow your account to preview the video's and have the correct access and moderation permissions on chat.fosdem.org, you must put your Penta username in your account information on [_volunteers.fosdem.org_](https://volunteers.fosdem.org). Go to the website and access your account details (_volunteers.fosdem.org/volunteers/<your username>/edit_). In the field _Your pentabarf account name_, enter the account name you either just created or already have on _penta.fosdem.org_. Click on _Save changes_.

It can take some time before everything is configured correctly, as the changes are made with batch jobs. If it is urgent (e.g. during FOSDEM), contact us in the [_#infodesk_](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#INFODESK:fosdem.org) channel on _chat.fosdem.org_.

### Get in touch

As soon as you have been confirmed as a host on one or more talks, get in touch with the speaker. Introduce yourself as the talk host to the speaker (we will provide you with a way to contact them) a few days before the conference, explaining what you will be doing during the conference.

### Watch the video
Before the conference, take some time to watch the video so you know what it's about. If there is a problem with the video or the quality is not good, contact the speaker immediatly.

## During the conference
Test your setup, especially your microphone and webcam.

### Enter the chatroom
You should have received two invitations. One is for the main (public) chat room, where the viewers will be, and one is for the backstage chat room, where you can talk with the speaker and any FOSDEM staff present in private.
